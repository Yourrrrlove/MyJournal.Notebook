Microsoft has decided to **continue mainstream support for OneNote 2016** to align it with Office 2019.

Also, please read [Frequently Asked Questions about OneNote in Office 2019 and Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/frequently-asked-questions-about-onenote-and-office-2019-6582c7ae-2ec6-408d-8b7a-3ed71a3c2103 "https://support.office.com/en-us/article/frequently-asked-questions-about-onenote-and-office-2019-6582c7ae-2ec6-408d-8b7a-3ed71a3c2103") for more information.

While I consider this add-in to be feature complete, I am now willing to consider enhancement requests or other contributions to this project.
