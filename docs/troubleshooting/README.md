## Scripts
The scripts in this directory can be used to provide information about your Microsoft® OneNote® program and features.

Windows Command Scripts (`.cmd`) are provided as a convenience to wrap the PowerShell Script (`.ps1`) with the same name in order to bypass the default "Restricted" execution policy.

- **[Get-OneNote-Info.cmd] ([Get-OneNote-Info.ps1])** &mdash; Displays information about the location of the ONENOTE.EXE file and image type (32-bit or 64-bit).

- **[List-OneNote-Notebooks.cmd] ([List-OneNote-Notebooks.ps1])** &mdash; Uses the OneNote Component Object Model (COM) API to display a list of notebooks.
